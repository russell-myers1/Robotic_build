      <h2>Mechanical Transmission & Motion Control</h2>
    
      <h3>Overview of the Transmission System</h3>
      <p>The robotic arm employs a dual-stage transmission system designed to maximize torque output and precision control. This transmission combines two distinct stages: a pulley-based initial reduction followed by a gear-based reduction. Together, these stages significantly amplify torque and improve positional accuracy.</p>
    
      <h3>Stage 1: Pulley-Based Reduction</h3>
      <p>The initial stage utilizes a <strong>belt-driven pulley system</strong>, comprising a <strong>20-tooth driving pulley</strong> and an <strong>80-tooth driven pulley</strong>, resulting in a mechanical speed reduction ratio of <strong>4:1</strong></p>
    
      <p class="equation"><strong>Gear Ratio (Stage 1) = 1 + Driven Gear Teeth / Driving Gear Teeth = 80 / 20 = 4:1</strong></p>
    
      <h3>Stage 2: Gear-Based Reduction (Rotational Base)</h3>
      <p>The second stage incorporates gears for further reduction, specifically designed to control the robotic arm's <strong>rotational base</strong>. This stage consists of a <strong>15-tooth pinion gear</strong> driving a <strong>108-tooth hub-mounted gear</strong>, both sourced from GoBilda:</p>
    
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.gobilda.com/2303-series-steel-mod-0-8-pinion-gear-6mm-d-bore-15-tooth/" target="_blank">15-Tooth Pinion Gear</a></li>

      </ul>
    
      <p>This gear pairing achieves a further <strong>7.2:1</strong> reduction:</p>
    
      <p><strong>Gear Ratio (Stage 2) = Driven Gear Teeth / Driving Gear Teeth = 108 / 15 = 7.2:1</strong></p>
    
      <h3>Total Reduction Calculation</h3>
      <p>The combination of both pulley and gear stages provides an overall reduction ratio that multiplies the individual stage ratios:</p>
    
      <p><strong>Total Reduction = Stage 1 × Stage 2 = 4 × 7.2 = 28.8:1</strong></p>
    
      <p>This high total reduction ratio ensures the robotic arm has sufficient torque and precise control for smooth, accurate movements.</p>

      <h3>Stepper Motor Integration & Motion Control</h3>
      <p>A <strong>NEMA 17 stepper motor</strong> paired with a <strong>GT2 timing pulley</strong> drives the system. Throughout the design, considerations included whether to directly pivot joints with bearings or utilize a belt-driven approach. Ultimately, the belt-driven design was favored for its flexibility, ease of adjustment, and reliable power transmission.</p>

    <section id="electronics">
      <h2>Electronics & Power Management</h2>
      <h3>Powering the Raspberry Pi 5</h3>
      <p>The objective is to power the Raspberry Pi 5 using a 24V 15A power supply stepped down to 5V by a Pololu D36V50F5 buck converter. The design intends to power the Pi through its USB‑C port, which requires a resistor network (5.1kΩ pull‑down on the CC pins) to signal a valid 5V source.</p>
      <p><strong>Important Note:</strong> There is an untested issue regarding the USB‑C Power Delivery (PD) handshake required by the Raspberry Pi 5. Although the Pololu converter is designed to provide a stable 5V/5A output, some resources indicate potential random shutdowns or power warnings. An alternative is to power the Pi via its GPIO pins, though that method lacks the inherent fail safes of the dedicated USB‑C interface. Once the system is implemented, further updates will be provided on its performance and stability.</p>

      <h3>Motor Control & Stepper Systems</h3>
      <p>Two NEMA 17 stepper motors (rated at ~2A) are controlled using TB6600 drivers and an Arduino. The system utilizes a 24V, 15A power supply, with buck converters stepping down the voltage for both the Arduino (approx. 8V) and the Raspberry Pi (5V). Safety measures such as proper grounding and fuse protection are implemented to minimize electrical issues.</p>

    -->
      <h3>Fusing and Electrical Safety</h3>
      <p>The design employs a single fuse on the AC input line to simplify the system, protecting against major electrical issues with one main fuse. While fusing every DC line is recommended by some to prevent hazards, the current setup leverages the built‑in protections of the stepper drivers, buck converters, and the MeanWell power supply. In future iterations, a circuit breaker might be added to the main DC output line feeding the power distributor, further enhancing safety and fault isolation.</p>

      <h2>Original Setup & Adafruit Stepper Driver Limitations</h2>
      <p>
        Before transitioning to the current build, the face tracking system was powered by an 
        <strong>Adafruit Stepper Motor Hat</strong> directly attached to the Raspberry Pi. While 
        this setup confirmed the feasibility of hardware-software integration and provided a 
        simplified platform for testing face detection, it also introduced several limitations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Current Limit (~0.5 A/phase):</strong> The onboard driver and MOSFETs of the Adafruit board 
          are restricted to lower currents, making it unsuitable for larger motors requiring higher torque.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Limited Microstepping Control:</strong> The Hat’s hardware supports a fixed set of stepping 
          modes (e.g., single, double, interleaved, and microstepping), but doesn’t offer the finer 
          microstepping granularity available on dedicated drivers like TB6600 or TMC-series drivers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Library Constraints:</strong> Adafruit’s dedicated Python library for the Stepper Motor Hat 
          is simple to use, but also somewhat restrictive in speed and step rate due to the underlying 
          hardware design.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Despite these constraints, this initial setup provided an invaluable proof of concept. The system 
        was able to <strong>detect and track faces</strong> with the Raspberry Pi camera, 
        demonstrating the potential of an integrated hardware-software solution. This experience 
        ultimately guided the decision to adopt more robust, higher-current drivers and a more 
        mechanically capable system for the next phase of the project.
